# GBPW Custom Dash Implementation
This directory does not contain a Drupal module, but it contains the custom assets required to build the GBPW Dashboard using the 0.5.x branch of DKAN_DASH.

To initialize the project run:
`npm init`

To compile the code
`npm run build`

# Files
*custom.css*
Needs to be something here, even if it is empty, so the app doesn't error when it can't find this

*dataHandlers.js*
Same as above. There is an example in the repository. Implementations will contain domain specific logic.
